# ConfigToolForUniversity-HCMUT
I have a challenge that finish fixing this tool for school in 4 days.\
**Problem 1: All is .dll**\
I recieved a folder that all code is encode to ".dll" file so I have to change it to ".css" file by JetBrains dotPeek 2024.2.7\
**Problem 2: Find the line to fix and luckily**\
In thousands of files, I have to find 1 line to change, it took me 3 days (bruh). I can not use "ctrl + F" like you are thinking. The dotPeek app just enable to find "file name", not line in file. That is a big problem. It also can not export all file to VSCODE, just one by one. And as you kkow, thousands of files, I don't have enough time. But luckily, in the beautiful afternoon, some how I found it !\
**Prolem 3: Compile it !**\
I have to find the extension and framwork (its's Devexpress) of this tool to compile it. I was fear that I have to compile "all thousands files", it means that I have to move one by one. But luckily, I discovered that I just need to compile one file. It will create .dll file and my job is putting it again to root tool folder.
